/*
  Depending on which keyboard is enabled (BLE or MQTT), we define KEYBOARD_UP, KEYBOARD_DOWN and so on.
  These defines are used in keys.cpp, gui*.cpp and commandHandler.cpp
  Example:
  If BLE  is enabled, then KEYBOARD_UP will be the same as KEYBOARD_BLE_UP
  If MQTT is enabled, then KEYBOARD_UP will be the same as KEYBOARD_MQTT_UP
  If none of them is enabled, then KEYBOARD_UP will be the same as KEYBOARD_UP_DUMMY
  Doing so you can switch between the keyboards without changing the UI code (keys.cpp, gui*.cpp and commandHandler.cpp)
  If you need something different than this behaviour, then you can change the code in 'register_keyboardCommands()'
  or you can of course change keys.cpp, gui*.cpp and commandHandler.cpp so that they directly use KEYBOARD_BLE_UP or KEYBOARD_MQTT_UP etc.
