
This directory is intended for a pool of devices already contributed by the community of OMOTE.
Files in this directory won't get compiled by default.

If you want to use one of these devices, then
- copy the corresponding device folder from "/src/devices_pool/..." to "/src/devices/..."
- add the corresponding call to "register_device_*()" into "/src/main.cpp" (and include the device header file in "/src/main.cpp" as well)
- start using the commands defined by the device, e.g. by putting them in the hardware key map of "scene__default.cpp" or of a specific scene
