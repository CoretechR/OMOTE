## Case - Bulky Bottom

**File:** Case-Bulky-Bottom.stl

**Updates:** I had issues printing the standard case bottom on my printer, so I modified the case to remove some of the internal ridges. This version of the case bottom now has more flat surfaces that should allow for less supports and easier support removal. 

**Recomendations:** Use at least 2-3 perimeters when printing this part for strenth and use a very low infill percentage (5-10%) to prevent the print from getting too heavy. You only need enough infill to support the layers printed above it, not for strength.
